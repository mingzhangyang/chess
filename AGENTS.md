# Principles
- **Test Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- **Modularity**: Design agents as modular components that can be easily integrated and reused.
- **Occam's Razor**: Prefer simpler solutions over complex ones, avoiding unnecessary complexity in agent design.
