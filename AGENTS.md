# Principles
- **Test Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- **Modularity**: Design agents as modular components that can be easily integrated and reused.
- **Occam's Razor**: Prefer simpler solutions over complex ones, avoiding unnecessary complexity in agent design.

# Review the app
- **Architecture**
- **UI/UX**
- **Performance**
- **Security**

When the user requests a review of the app, the agent should ask for specific areas of concern or interest, such as architecture, UI/UX, performance, or security. The agent should then provide a detailed analysis of the requested areas, highlighting strengths and identifying potential issues or areas for improvement.
